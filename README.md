# Phase 3 Week 1(Python Toy Problems)

<Prerequisite>

1. Create a repository on your GitHub account.

2. Use Python to wire down the solution.

3. Push the solution to the above repository once done.

4. Submit the repository link for grading.

5. Ensure your repository has a well-written README.

 

NOTE: You are required to complete ALL the challenges.

 

# Challenge 1: 
There are N boxes (numbered from 0 to N−1) arranged in a row. The K-th box contains A[K] bricks. In one move you can take one brick from some box and move it to a box next to it (on the left or on the right). What is the minimum number of moves needed to end up with exactly 10 bricks in every box?


Write a function:

function solution(A);

that, given an array A of N integers, returns the minimum number of moves needed to end up with exactly 10 bricks in every box. If this is not possible, the function should return −1.


# Challenge 2: 
Write a function:

function solution(A);

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the maximum sum of two numbers whose digits add up to an equal sum. If there are no two numbers whose digits have an equal sum, the function should return -1.


# Challenge 3: 
Write a function solution that, given an integer N, returns a string of length N containing as many different lower-case letters ('a'-'z') as possible, in which each letter occurs an equal number of times.
